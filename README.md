# Service Virtualization Angular


>Service virtualization is the simulation of interfaces – not the virtualization of systems. Service virtualization lets you automatically execute tests even when the application under test’s dependent system components (APIs, third-party applications, etc.) cannot be properly accessed or configured for testing. By simulating these dependencies, you can ensure that your tests will encounter the appropriate dependency behavior and data each and every time that they execute.  It’s commonly used when integration tests or end-to-end tests need to interact with dependent system components that are:
>
>- Unreliable, evolving, or not yet completed
>- Beyond your scope of control (e.g., operated by another company or division
>- Available for testing only in limited capacity or at inconvenient time
>- Challenging to provision or configure in a test environment
>- Simultaneously needed by different teams with varied test data setup and other requirement
>- Too restricted or costly to use for automated regression testing
